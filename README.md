## Flow Storefront Listing Viewer

This is a sample project done at [LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/) that shows and refreshes the Listings every 2 seconds, based upon general purpose Cadence NFT Storefront Contract for trading NFTs on [Flow](https://flow.com/) blockchain. It is hosted at [Flow Storefront Listing](https://flow-storefront-listings.vercel.app/).
